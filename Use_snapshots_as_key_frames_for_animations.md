# Use snapshots as key frames for animations

Usually key frames for animation is presented on a timeline. 

A different approach is to have key frame hold the current information of a pose and only provide information about the transitions betweem the keyframes.

Using this approach key frames is presented as a snapshot (with image) of the key frame and transitions contain information about duration and interpolation bewteen the key frames.
